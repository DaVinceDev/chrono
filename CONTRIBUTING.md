# Contribution Guidelines

This project is personally supervised and led by me as the creator of this language. I have a clear vision of what features and changes align with the language’s goals and direction, and I am the sole decision-maker on what gets added or modified.

Contributions in the form of pull requests are welcome and appreciated as they can help improve and shape the language. However, please understand that submitting a pull request does not guarantee immediate acceptance. I review contributions carefully and make decisions based on the project’s best interests and vision. Some contributions may require discussion, revision, or may be declined if they don’t fit the direction I have set.

Thank you for your interest, effort, and understanding. Your contributions play a vital role in the growth of this language.
