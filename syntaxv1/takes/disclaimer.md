This is the first version of the syntax in the language, suggestions may be proposed but don't expect me to accept it. At least right away.

Plus, I like zig syntax and decided to copy some most of the stuff, either because it just makes sense to code that way or its conventional.

If you feel like some the syntax features don't make sense or it's unconventional, make a constructive critic. I will not be giving my time to hear a empty 
critic even less consider your opinion. If you don't like it, it's on you, and you always have the choice to just use something else or just write your own 
language (like me lol).
