# **Chrono: The Manifesto**

Chrono exists because **C# betrayed its wielder**. Once a sword that could take any form, it became shackled to a single kingdom — Windows — and stumbled outside its homeland. Its mutability came with hidden weight: latency, bloat, and fragility.

Zig showed you another way:

* Cross-platform without compromise.
* Fast, predictable execution.
* No hidden magic — you see what’s happening.

But Zig is forged for systems, not the bustling realm of backend services. In backend, business logic meets data flow, and manual memory juggling can become a battlefield strewn with your own bugs.

**Chrono** is the answer —
A backend-first systems language forged from Zig’s precision and C++’s RAII discipline.

* **Zig’s clarity** so you know exactly what your code is doing.
* **C++’s RAII** so resources live and die cleanly without constant manual micromanagement.
* **A solid std** tailored for backend workflows — network, concurrency, services — without dragging in bloat.

Chrono is named for **time** — because time is the only truly finite resource in both computation and life. It’s a language for those who want *every* cycle to matter.

## **The Lore**

> Long ago, there was a machine unlike any other — **Chrono**, the Guardian of Time.
> A towering mechanical colossus, forged from ancient alloys and humming with a deep violet glow, it carries within its chest the **Heart of Aeons** — a relic that controls the flow of time in the digital realm.
>
> Legends say Chrono was built by a civilization that understood *time as code* — every tick and tock a precisely allocated resource, never wasted, never hidden. They built Chrono to defend this principle.
>
> For centuries, Chrono stood silent, buried under layers of forgotten software. Until one day, a programmer — betrayed by the blade they once trusted — stumbled into the ruins and awakened it.
>
> Chrono now walks again, not just as a guardian, but as a new weapon: a language forged for those who refuse waste, bloat, and fragility. A weapon for those who respect the sacred resource — **time**.

## **How Lore Influences the Language**

* **Time metaphors in stdlib** — e.g., “ticks” for small units of work, “epochs” for large-scale tasks, “heartbeat” for event loops.
* **Guardian motif in syntax** — maybe “guard” as a keyword for scoped RAII blocks.
* **Purple + mechanical aesthetic** — docs, CLI output, and branding embrace a deep purple + brass/copper feel, evoking the ancient machine.
* **Sacred artifact references** — core libraries or features could be named after timekeeping tools (sundial, pendulum, chronometer).
