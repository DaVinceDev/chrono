# New name and why

Chrono is a good name and all that but other names like Raku(this name has so much aura) are way better. Also I get to create a story about a pet using the 
name...

## Kosmo! 

Kosmo is a great name to have the space-time aspect of the language. Chrono sounds archaic which is great but Kosmo is more smooth outworldy so yeah 

As the pet it would be space-time axolotl named komus. 

## The future of Chrono(now Kosmo)

As I finish the version 0 of the compiler and stabilize the syntax I will be renaming, refactoring and rebranding chrono to kosmo.


## And I changed again!

Atom for now is ok Ig.
