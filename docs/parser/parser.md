# Parser Documentation

The parser struct(**Parser**) is located at `../../src/chrono/parser.zig` and 
contains 3 fields: `allocator`, `tokens` and `index`.

The `allocator` field is responsible for realizing allocations of **AST nodes**. 

The `tokens` field is the tokens generated by the **Tokenizer**.

The `index` field is used for walking the token list.

The parsing process is just is really just a loop that makes checks of token 
order. To ensure that, for example, a variable declaraion is in the order:

`keyword → identifier → colon → type → equal → value → semi-colon`

If not the compiler raises an error. And that goes for every token.

After the order check, the creation of node happens. Allocating memory and 
assigning the values to the node, append the node the **node list** and 
increse the index position. That over and over until it reaches EOF.

Then the node list is returned.

IMPORTANT NOTE 1: DUPLICATING ELEMENTS MAKE THE PROCESS SLOW SO WE ROCK WITH 
THE REFERENCE.

IMPORTANT NOTE 2: IF THE PARSER RETURNS NULL, THEN: 

```zig 

if (self.index + 1 >= self.tokens.len or 
self.tokens[self.index + 1].token_type == .EOF) return null;

```

All this process resides in the **ParseTokens()** function.
